### Objective:

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; **[Phishing](https://www.imperva.com/learn/application-security/phishing-attack-scam/)** is a type of social engineering attack often used to steal user data, including login credentials and credit card numbers. It occurs when an attacker, masquerading as a trusted entity, dupes a victim into opening an email, instant message, or text message. The recipient is then tricked into clicking a malicious link, which can lead to the installation of malware, the freezing of the system as part of a ransomware attack or the revealing of sensitive information. An attack can have devastating results. For individuals, this includes unauthorized purchases, the stealing of funds, or identify theft.

Did you know that [91% ](https://www.googleadservices.com/pagead/aclk?sa=L&ai=DChcSEwiBnP_Z8rf9AhVH7O0KHYdwDHcYABAAGgJkZw&ohost=www.google.com&cid=CAESbeD2sOgzZ1ee7rJd_wc_-Za_QH9TNJ9GzFiI4m5IgAWuICh4oDp6oNclW0o2CUEi9VX0hDZXXMr0ncrZwKv-HJ1Dw98DQ8YUY80GRFXNFjaAx_azeWOvkHOJf9UIJ4rl18R__C65AUG8AojYFWY&sig=AOD64_0uc7BBmfArAG1gF7i_K7DHHcZJsQ&q&adurl&ved=2ahUKEwjf9vHZ8rf9AhXJa8AKHeBfD0cQ0Qx6BAgDEAE&nis=8) of successful data breaches started with a spear phishing attack.?

As technology continues to grow, phishing techniques started to progress rapidly and this needs to be prevented by using anti-phishing mechanisms to detect phishing. Machine learning and deep Learning are powerful tools used to strive against phishing attacks. So in this project, we will predict phishing (Sites and Messages) and fish what's phishing you.



### Dataset Overview:
#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - **For URL**

The dataset is available through the [Kaggle.](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/siddharthkumar25/malicious-and-benign-urls?resource=download)
This dataset contains only the URLs and Type.

**The Malicious is classified into:**
| Type               | Describes                                                                                                                                                              |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
[Defacement](https://www.imperva.com/learn/application-security/website-defacement-attack/)|Web defacement is an attack in which malicious parties penetrate a website and replace content on the site with their own messages. The messages can convey a political or religious message, profanity or other inappropriate content that would embarrass website owners, or a notice that the website has been hacked by a specific hacker group.
[Phishing](https://www.barracuda.com/support/glossary/url-phishing)|Cybercriminals use phishing URLs to try to obtain sensitive information for malicious use, such as usernames, passwords, or banking details. They send phishing emails to direct their victims to enter sensitive information on a fake website that looks like a legitimate website.
[Malware](https://gatefy.com/blog/what-malicious-url/)|Malicious URL is a link created with the purpose of promoting scams, attacks, and frauds. By clicking on an infected URL, you can download ransomware, virus, trojan, or any other type of malware that will compromise your machine or even your network, in the case of a compan

For the URL part, features extraction has been done including URL length, URL digit count, URL letter count, URL Special character count ... etc.

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - **For SMS and Email**
The dataset is available through the [Kaggle.](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset)
This dataset contains only the Text and Type including(Ham and Spam).

We used Machine Learning technique.

| Model               | Accuracy                                                                                                                                                              |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
Logistic regression |97%
Gradient Boosting	|98%
Decision Tree	| 97%
Random Forest|	98%

**Reason for choosing the models:**
- After multiple research, we found two reaserch papers that used Decesion Tree, Random Forest and Logistic Regression and show high accuracy results. [[1]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.05121.pdf)[[2]](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Rishikesh-Mahajan/publication/328541785_Phishing_Website_Detection_using_Machine_Learning_Algorithms/links/5d0397fd92851c9004394af4/Phishing-Website-Detection-using-Machine-Learning-Algorithms.pdf)
- For the Gradient Boosting model we also found a research paper[[1]](https://www.ijraset.com/research-paper/url-based-phishing-website-detection)[[2]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9400317) that used this model and it shows a high acuracy result. 

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - **For SMS and Email**
We used Deep Learning technique.
| Model               | Accuracy                                                                                                                                                              |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
Sequential Model |	98%

**Reason for choosing the model:**
- After multiple research, we found two articles that used sequential model [[1]](https://www.twilio.com/blog/spam-deep-learning-detection-sms-keras-python-twilio)[[2]](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/detecting-spam-emails-using-tensorflow-in-python/)and show high accuracy results. 

### Final Results and Conclusion:

### Conclusion:
Nowadays, phishing websitesand spam messages increased rapidly and causing more damage to the users and organizations. It is becoming a biggest threat to peopleâ€™s daily life and the networking environment. In these attacks, the intruder act as trustable party intention to access an essential information. Phishing website is a mock website that looks similar in appearance but different in destination. The unsuspected users post their data thinking that these websites come from trusted financial institutions. Hence, there is a need for efficient mechanism for the detection of phishing website. The spam masseage is message that recevied to user with harm links or content to damage or steals user credintials information. In our project, we developed machine and deep learning models that can be mainly used in determining the websiteâ€™s as either phishing or legitimate and message either spam or ham by using the features extraction techniques from the URL and text messages. Here, in our project we applied Gradient Boost for URL and Sequential model for SMS and e-mail messages. During testing, it has been observed that the system has performed well and as expected.
